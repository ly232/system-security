Some idea about the project.

  * DataBase Vs File System.
     # (I would prefer DataBase, Although it take some time to familiar with JDBC, it would prevent us from disorganize)
  * Communicate between Server and Client
      # since we do not using browser, we would not using HTTP, we have to build our own rules for communicate. I think XML is a good format.
  * Test
      # using JUnit for testing, write testcases for every function we write, may write some integrate test afterwards.
