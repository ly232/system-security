# Phase 2 #

## Introduction ##
Some idea about the project.


## Details ##

  * Database vs File System.
    1. (I would prefer Database, Although it take some time to familiar with JDBC, it would prevent us from disorganize)
  * Communicate between Server and Client
    1. since we do not using browser, we would not using HTTP, we have to build our own rules for communicate. I think XML is a good format.
  * Test
    1. using JUnit for testing, write testcases for every function we write, may write some integrate test afterwards.
